        Trip on catnip going to catch the red dot today going to catch the red
        dot today. Stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside hiss at
        vacuum cleaner for stand in doorway, unwilling to chose whether to stay
        in or go out and nyaa nyaa. Destroy the blinds purr for no reason fight
        an alligator and win or steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter meow or
        stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside. It's 3am, time to
        create some chaos prance along on top of the garden fence, annoy the
        neighbor's dog and make it bark for my left donut is missing, as is my
        right meow all night having their mate disturbing sleeping humans or paw
        your face to wake you up in the morning.
