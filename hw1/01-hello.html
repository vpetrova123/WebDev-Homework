        I am a dental hygienist working towards getting my Bachelor's Degree in
        Computer Science at Portland State University. While I love dentistry,
        I've always had a passion towards technology. I thrive in a fast-paced
        environment and love learning new concepts, which is perfect since
        technology is always evolving. My experience has adapted me to work
        great on my own as well as part of a team. While working towards my
        goals, I'm hoping to have the opportunity to participate in an
        internship to allow me to grow as a programmer.
